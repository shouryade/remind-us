# Technologies Used

## Backend - Fully Serverless

- **Netlify Functions:** 🚀 Leveraged for serverless architecture, these functions serve as AWS Lambda equivalents, enabling efficient and scalable backend operations.
- **Cloud Firestore:** 🗃 Utilized as the database solution, Cloud Firestore provides a serverless, NoSQL document database to store and manage data seamlessly.
- **Google Calendar API:** 📅 Integrated for setting notifications and reminders, the Google Calendar API enhances the application's functionality, providing a robust scheduling mechanism.

## Frontend

- **Preact:** ⚛️ A lightweight alternative to React, Preact was chosen for the frontend, offering a delightful development experience with fast rendering and efficient components. Its nimble nature perfectly complemented the dance of technologies, adding to the overall elegance of the application.
- **daisyUI:** 🌼 daisyUI adds component class names to Tailwind CSS so you can make beautiful websites faster than ever.

## Development Experience

Building with these technologies was an exciting journey, particularly as I explored the world of serverless architecture and seamlessly integrated APIs for dynamic features. The blend of Netlify Functions, Cloud Firestore, Google Calendar API, and Preact not only made development joyful but also yielded a modern and efficient application. It truly highlights the power and versatility of cutting-edge technologies.
